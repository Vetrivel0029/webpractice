    <p> Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak,
         upright stance, and clawed feet.[a] They are classified in four
        families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

    <p>The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots),
         Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are 
         threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any
          other comparable bird group.[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species
           inhabiting temperate regions as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.[5]</p>
